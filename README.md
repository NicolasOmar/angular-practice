Repository created to record my practice learning Angular with exercises based on the [Udemy Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-guide-to-angular-2/) of [Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller](https://www.udemy.com/user/maximilian-schwarzmuller/).

## Status
- Current repo's version is ![Angular practice version](https://img.shields.io/github/package-json/v/nicolasomar/angular-practice?color=success&label=%20&style=flat-square)

### What does that version number mean?
| Number | Meaning |
| ------ | ------ |
| `X.0.0` | Course hasn't been completed |
| `0.X.0` | How many assignments/examples I have completed |
| `0.0.X` | How many times I have updated the next assignment/example |

### Why it has not any updated dependencies?
After finishing its related Udemy course, I archive this repository and unarchive it when I start a new training and add a link in the [`Other practice repos`](#other-practice-repos) section referring to its new repo. But I don't update any associated dependency due to technology changes during the years between each practice, and the produced code which works with the mentioned [`requirements`](#requirements).

## Requirements
 - [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) `v12.16.1` or above
 - [Angular CLI](https://cli.angular.io/) by running the command `npm run setup-angular` or `npm i -g @angular/cli`

## Repo structure
For a better search, I divided the lessons I learned in the following folders:
- `1-learning`: An app used to show every assignment and example besides the main project.
- `2-project`: A single page application used to apply all the knowledge as the main project.

## Setup
After cloning the repo, go to the created folder and install the node packages (including [Angular CLI](https://cli.angular.io/) at the global level).
```sh
git clone https://github.com/NicolasOmar/angular-practice.git
cd angular-practice
npm run setup-all
```
`setup-all` is the command to install all the projects, but if you want to do it one by one, you can change that last line for one of the following:
| App Setup | Command |
| ------ | ------ |
| All | `npm run setup-all` |
| Learning | `npm run setup-learning` |
| Project | `npm run setup-project` |

## How to run it
To run the app in a new browser instance, run the following command in the project's folder:
```sh
npm start
```
In case you stopped the Angular service and don't want to open a new tab, run the following command:
```sh
ng serve
```
