# Angular Practice
Repository created to record my practice learning Angular with exercises based on the [Udemy Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-guide-to-angular-2/) of [Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller](https://www.udemy.com/user/maximilian-schwarzmuller/).

## Repo Structure
For a better search, I divided the lessons I learned in the following folders:
- `1-learning`: An app used to show every assignment and example besides the main project.
- `2-project`: A single page application used to apply all the knowledge as the main project.

## Requirements
 - [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) v12.16.1 or above
 - [Angular CLI](https://cli.angular.io/) by running the command `npm run setup-angular` or `npm i -g @angular/cli`

## Setup
| App Setup | Command |
| ------ | ------ |
| All | npm run setup-all |
| Learning | npm run setup-learning |
| Project | npm run setup-project |

## How to run it
To run the app in a new browser instance, run the following command in the project's folder:
```sh
npm start
```
In case you stopped the Angular service and don't want to open a new tab, run the following command:
```sh
ng serve
```

   - Understanding of `core`, `shared` and `feature module` concepts for module creation
   - Separate routing configs in each module
   - How to improve app performance and loading implementing `Lazy Loading`
