# Angular Practice
Repository created to record my practice learning Angular with exercises base on [Angular Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-guide-to-angular-2/) of [Maximilian Schwarzmüller](https://www.udemy.com/user/maximilian-schwarzmuller/).

## Requirements
 - [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) v12.16.1 or above

## Setup
To install all dependencies (including [angular-cli](https://cli.angular.io/) set up at a global level), execute the following command in the project´s folder:
```sh
npm run setup
```

## How to run it
To run the app in a new browser instance, execute the following command in the project´s folder:
```sh
npm start
```
In case you stopped the Angular service and don´t want to open a new tab, execute the following:
```sh
ng serve
```

## What did I learn?
 - Basic understanding of a `Component`
 - How to use a `Decorator` to declare a Component
 - Understand what `String Interpolation` is
 - How to use `DataBinding` (one or two-way) and `EventBinding`
